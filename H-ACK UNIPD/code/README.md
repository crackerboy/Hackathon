# WikiUNIPD
This is the prototype of the app submitted during H-ack UNIPD, an hackathon organized by <a href="http://www.h-farm.com/"> H-FARM</a>
and the <a href="http://www.unipd.it/">University of Padua</a>. 
With this app, my team and I won the first price. 
#How it works
With this app, students can find the best library, studying room and canteen near them. They can also rate 
the place to make it better. You can find more information on the official <a href="https://github.com/prof18/WikiUNIPD/blob/master/WikiUnipd.pdf"> presentation</a>.
